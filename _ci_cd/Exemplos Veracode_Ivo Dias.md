description: "In this repository you will find several examples for Veracode implementations created by the [M3Corp](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community) team. In the [Pipelines](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/Pipelines) folder you can find how to implement in the most diverse CI/CD tools, such as [Azure](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/Pipelines/Az%20DevOps), [GitLab](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/Pipelines/GitLab), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/Pipelines/GitHub%20Actions) and [Jenkins](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/Pipelines/Jenkins). Other implementation examples such as running in a [terminal](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/SOs) and [translating the results](https://github.com/M3Corp-Community/Veracode/tree/main/FreeStyle) are also available. We normally publish in Portuguese, but the examples are completely understandable in other languages"
